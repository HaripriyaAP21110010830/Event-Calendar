# Event Calendar App
------------------------------------------------
React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

ðŸ§°Technologies Used
------------------------
React Components:
App.jsx handles overall logic, state management, and renders UI.
Calendar.jsx displays the monthly calendar and individual date cells.

State Management:
useState, useEffect hooks are used to manage selected date, events, filters, form data, and more.

Event Conflict Detection:
Checks if an event overlaps with another at the same time and date before allowing submission or drag/drop.

Responsive UI:
CSS media queries and flexbox/grid layouts are used to ensure usability on all screen sizes.

Filtering & Searching:
Filters events by title and category dynamically using controlled input elements.

Recurring Events Logic:
Uses date-fns and conditional logic to render repeating events based on recurrence type (daily, weekly, monthly).
